# reporting-jira-cloud
Script for extracting data from Jira Cloud API's for reporting purposes using a Jira Issues Filter

# Dependencies
- Python 3.9
- See requirements.txt (use: pip install -r requirements.txt)

# Configuration Setup
The Jira authentication settings and label lookup data is stored in jira_conf.yaml

To stop any changes to this file getting back into Git use:
```
# use --no-skip-worktree to undo
git update-index --skip-worktree jira_conf.yaml
```
## Jira authentication
Create an API Token against your Atlassian account and store it somewhere safe:
https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/

Edit jira_conf.yaml and set the url, user and token. These are the values speciific to your Jira instance, example:
```yaml
- jira:
    url: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/
    user: me@example.com
    token: my-api-token
```

## Lookups (labels)
The team and category data is based on specific labels against a Jira issue (ticket). The label used to represent a team should be added to jira_conf.yaml under
the "team" section and the work category under the "category" section. The lookup uses lowercase, so please ensure you add the key in lowercase (e.g. "team1", not "TEAM1).

Edit jira_conf.yaml and set add the relevant entries to the "team" and "category" sections. The first value (key) should be the label in lowercase and the second value
the value you want to be displayed as, example:
```yaml
- team:
    team1: My team
    team2: Another team
- category:
    project: Project
```

## Filters
These can also be added to jira_conf.yaml as a lookup, using a more memborable name as ids can be difficult to remember.

Edit jira_conf.yaml and add your filters to the "filter" sections. The first value (key) should be easy to remember name with no spaces and the second value
the id of the filter setup in Jira, example:
```yaml
- filter:
    work_done: 12345
```
Please note that the filter should have a description set in Jira as this is used as the filename when generating the .CSV file.

# Details
## extract.py

Extracts Jira issue data based on a Jira Filter ID that can be supplied as a parameter or retrieved from jira_conf.yaml

Each search generates a .CSV file in the data folder, using the description text for the filter in Jira as the file name. If there is no descritpion, the Jira Filter ID will be used.
To improve performance we currently only request the following fields in the search:
- summary
- status
- created
- resolutiondate
- components
- labels
- issuetype
- customfield_10023 (Time in Status)
- customfield_10024 (Story Points)

Team and Category resolution is based on labels and driven by the lookup data in jira_conf.yaml. All keys should be lowercase to enable matching.

There are two different column output options, summary and detailed. Summary returns "Key", "Summary", "Category", "Team", "Status", "Created", "Resolved". Detailed column output should only be used for filters that return completed (Done) Jira Issues. Detailed columns include the summary columns, plus "Issue Type", "Story Points", "Days Open" and the following status columns that represent the number of days the issue spent in the following status:
- To Do
- In Progress
- Ready to Review
- QA Test
- Ready to Release
- QA Test Dev
- Ready to Promote to Stage (Ready for Stage)
- QA Test Stage
- Ready to Promote to Prod (Ready for Prod)

The days calculation for the status transitions include weekends and is rounded to 2 decimal places. Days Open is the total lead time, between ticket creation and resolution.

The total number of issues extracted, and the name of the file created are output on successful execution. Any unresolved teams will be reported, along with the Jira Issue ID and unresolved categories will just be reported as "Unknown" in the .CSV

## report.py
Takes the data from a .CSV generated by extract.py and pivots the data to create an excel spreadsheet for the number of issues completed by the team, grouped by category. Both the summary and detail column formats can be used and any issues that don't have a status of "Done" are not included in the results. The team and category labels defined in jira_conf.yaml are used to drive the data displayed. It also generates a .PNG that charts the data for each team in graph format.
# Run
Generates a .CSV file with basic summary columns for the first filter defined in jira_conf.yaml
```python
py extract.py
```
Generates a .CSV file with detailed columns for the filter id or filter defined in jira_conf.yaml
```python
py extract.py 12345
py extract.py work_done
```
Generates a .CSV file with basic summary columns for the filter id or filter defined in jira_conf.yaml
```python
py extract.py -s 12345
py extract.py -s work_done
```
Generates a .CSV file with detailed columns for the filter id or filter defined in jira_conf.yaml
```python
py extract.py -d 12345
py extract.py -d work_done
```
Generates a .PNG and .XLSX file covering the total number of issues completed, grouped by category, for each team defined in jira_conf.yaml. The input is the file name created by extract.py
```python
py report.py './/data//12345 (2021-06-24) SUMMARY.csv'
```
Generates a .PNG and .XLSX file covering the total number of issues completed, grouped by category, for the team specified. The input is the file name created by extract.py
```python
py report.py './/data//12345 (2021-06-24) SUMMARY.csv' -t "My team"
```
